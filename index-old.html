					<p>An illustrator and designer since childhood, I understand the incredible power of a compelling visual experience to attract and delight users, build customer admiration and loyalty, and establish a strong brand in the marketplace. However, without the structural, behavioral, and informational front-end components that frame, drive, and bring the larger user experience to life, the visual presentation is little more than eye-candy. And in order to achieve these things efficiently and consistently, the right technologies, tools, and workflows are essential.</p>
					<p>Knowing what these elements are and being able to properly implement them is no small thing. The days of hiring a freelance designer to create hi-fidelity Photoshop mockups, an information architect to manufacture dozens of detailed wireframes, and a developer to write code that only works for Internet Explorer on screens at least 960 pixels wide, are no more. Today, cross-discipline teams utilizing rough sketches, style tiles, front-end frameworks, in-browser design prototypes, agnostic development, and agile workflows are the norm.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="small-12 large-6 columns">
					<p>Organizing, mentoring and providing direction to these creative and technical teams to ensure their production is greater than the sum of their parts requires a leader who has been there and done that; someone able to work closely with executives and stakeholders to make sure they are effectively informed and involved; and someone who can do it with professional integrity and character.</p>
					<p>I have been providing that direction, leadership, and expertise to large enterprises seeking to transform burdensome legacy applications into modern, mobile-friendly, interactive service touchpoints for their constituents and customers on a local and national level. Numerous smaller clients have also benefited from my assistance with visual and interaction design, front-end development, information architecture, storyboarding, usability testing, user research, content and digital strategy, copy writing, art direction, and branding and identity design.</p>
